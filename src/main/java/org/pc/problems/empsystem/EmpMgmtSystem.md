    id, name, salary

    abstract method calculateBonus()

2. Create two subclasses:

    FullTimeEmployee

    ContractEmployee

3. Store multiple employees in a List.

4. Allow the user to:

    Add employees

    Remove employees by ID

    Search employee by name

    Display all employees sorted by salary

5. Throw a custom exception if the employee does not exist.
