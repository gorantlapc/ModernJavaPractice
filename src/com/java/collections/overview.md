# Overview of Java Collections Framework

The Java Collections Framework (JCF) is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections of objects in Java. It provides a set of interfaces, implementations, and algorithms that facilitate data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. The framework is part of the `java.util` package and is widely used in Java programming for handling groups of objects.

### **Core Interfaces and Their Use Cases**

| Interface | Description                           | Common Implementations                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **List**  | Ordered collection, allows duplicates | `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Vector`   |
| **Set**   | Unordered collection, no duplicates   | `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `TreeSet` |
| **Queue** | FIFO (First In First Out) structure   | `PriorityQueue`, `ArrayDeque`         |
| **Map**   | Key–Value pairs (unique keys)         | `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `TreeMap` |
